Before you begin coding, write an algorithm that represents the steps necessary to play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock in a best-of-three format. By writing out the steps, it will make you think about every piece needed to bring the game to life. Please submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start

1. Display welcome
2. Display rules (best 2/3 and gestures options)
3. User selects single (human vs AI) or multiplayer (human vs human, AI vs AI)
    a. Instantiate objects (players)
4. Players choose gestures
5. Print results
6. Winner displayed
7. Best 2/3 - repeat until winner
8. Option to play again




In video feedback, can I be shown how to write the game logic more efficiently instead of repeating everything and reversing just the player&gesture?
